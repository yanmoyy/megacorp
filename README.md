# megacorp (Git-2 Advanced)

The starter repo for the [Git 2 course](https://www.boot.dev/learn/learn-git-2)
on Boot.dev.

## Goal (Chapter List)

1. `Fork`: Learn how to fork a repository and contribute to open source projects
2. `Reflog`: Work with the reference log to recover lost commits
3. `Merge Conflicts`: Understand merge conflicts, how they arise, and how to
   resolve them
4. `Rebase Conflicts`: Learn about rebase conflicts and how to safely keep the
   project history clean
5. `Squash`: Many teams require developers to squash commits, learn how and why
   you would do it
6. `Stash`: You don't always need to use branches to work on multiple things at
   once, learn how the stash can save time
7. `Revert`: Git reset is a bit of a blunt tool, learn about git revert and how
   to safely undo changes
8. `Cherry Pick`: Use git cherry pick to selectively move changes from one
   branch to another
9. `Bisect`: Slogging through git history can be time consuming, learn how git
   bisect can find bugs fast
10. `Worktrees`: Learn when git worktrees can be better than regular old
    branches when it comes to parallel development
11. `Tags`: Learn how to use git tags properly to version and release your code
